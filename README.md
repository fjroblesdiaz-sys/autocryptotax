# Auto Crypto Tax 🪙💰

**Auto Crypto Tax** is a web application designed to simplify cryptocurrency tax declarations for Spanish citizens. The platform enables users to connect their cryptocurrency wallets and automatically generate tax reports ready to submit to the Agencia Tributaria (Hacienda).

## 📋 Overview

Managing cryptocurrency tax obligations in Spain can be complex and time-consuming. Auto Crypto Tax streamlines this process by:

- **Connecting to multiple wallets**: Integrate various cryptocurrency wallets to consolidate all your transactions
- **Automated report generation**: Automatically calculate gains, losses, and generate compliant tax reports
- **Spain-specific compliance**: Reports formatted according to Spanish tax authority (Hacienda) requirements
- **User-friendly interface**: Modern, intuitive UI built with best practices in mind

## 🎯 Purpose

The Spanish tax system requires citizens to declare cryptocurrency holdings and transactions. This includes:

- Model 720: Declaration of assets and rights abroad
- Model 100: Personal Income Tax (IRPF) - for gains and losses
- Model 714: Wealth Tax (Impuesto sobre el Patrimonio)

Auto Crypto Tax aims to automate the generation of these declarations, reducing errors and saving time for Spanish cryptocurrency investors.
