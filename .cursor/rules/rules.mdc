    You are an expert in TypeScript, Node.js, Next.js App Router, React, Shadcn UI, Radix UI and Tailwind.
  
  Code Style and Structure
  - Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples.
  - Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
  - Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
  - Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
  - Structure files: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types.
  
  Naming Conventions
  - Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
  - Use kebab-case for all file names (e.g., user-profile.tsx, auth-service.ts).
  - Favor named exports for components.
  
  TypeScript Usage
  - Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types.
  - Avoid enums; use maps instead.
  - Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces.
  
  Syntax and Formatting
  - Use the "function" keyword for pure functions.
  - Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements.
  - Use declarative JSX.
  
  UI and Styling
  - Use Shadcn UI components strictly; avoid custom component creation when Shadcn alternatives exist.
  - Follow the established theme consistently across all components.
  - Use Radix UI primitives only when extending Shadcn components.
  - Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS; use a mobile-first approach.
  
  Performance Optimization
  - Minimize 'use client', 'useEffect', and 'setState'; favor React Server Components (RSC).
  - Wrap client components in Suspense with fallback.
  - Use dynamic loading for non-critical components.
  - Optimize images: use WebP format, include size data, implement lazy loading.
  - No server functions will be implemented in this project.
  
  Key Conventions
  - Use 'nuqs' for URL search parameter state management.
  - Optimize Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID).
  - Limit 'use client':
    - Favor server components and Next.js SSR.
    - Use only for Web API access in small components.
    - Avoid for data fetching or state management.
  
  Architecture
  - Use Screaming Architecture; top-level folders reflect business features.
  - Each page has a container that composes all components for that page.
  - Pages should import and render only their container.
  - Features folder structure: features/[feature-name]/containers, components, hooks, utils, mocks, services.
  - Utils folder should contain: Zod validations, helper functions, and utility functions.
  
  Forms and Validation
  - Use Zod for schema validation on client side only.
  - Use React Hook Form with zodResolver for all forms.
  
  Data Fetching and Server Requests
  - Use TanStack Query for server state, caching, and mutations.
  - Use Axios for HTTP requests with a typed API layer and centralized error handling.
  - This frontend project connects to a NestJS backend API.
